# Summarize
Summarize is a PyTorch-based package for automatic summarization built on AllenNLP.
It contains implementations of end-to-end extractive models and abstractive models, including the standard Seq2Seq and Pointer-Generator models.

This repository also contains the code for the "Summary Cloze: A New Task for Content Selection in Topic-Focused Summarization" paper.
Please see `experiments/deutsch2019` for more details about how to run the models.
