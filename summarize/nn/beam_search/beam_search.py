class BeamSearch(FromParams):
    """
    Implements the beam search algorithm for decoding the most likely sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_size : ``int``
        The width of the beam used.
    namespace : ``str``, optional (default = ``tokens``)
        The vocabulary namespace of the output symbols.
    end_symbol : ``str``, optional (default = ``END_SYMBOL``)
        The symbol of the "stop" or "end" token in the target vocabulary.
    min_steps : ``int``, optional (default = ``None``)
        The minimum number of decoding steps to take, i.e. the minimum length
        of the predicted sequences. This does not include the start or end tokens.
        No minimum is enforced if ``None``
    max_steps : ``int``, optional (default = 50)
        The maximum number of decoding steps to take, i.e. the maximum length
        of the predicted sequences.
    per_node_beam_size : ``int``, optional (default = beam_size)
        The maximum number of candidates to consider per node, at each step in the search.
        If not given, this just defaults to ``beam_size``. Setting this parameter
        to a number smaller than ``beam_size`` may give better results, as it can introduce
        more diversity into the search. See `Beam Search Strategies for Neural Machine Translation.
        Freitag and Al-Onaizan, 2017 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01806>`_.
    disallow_repeated_ngrams: ``int``, optional (default = ``None``)
        The order of n-gram to prevent repetitions of. If ``None``, any order n-gram
        can be repeated.
    repeated_ngrams_exceptions: ``List[List[str]]``, optional (default = ``None``)
        A list of n-grams which are exceptions to the disallowed rules.
    length_penalizer: ``LengthPenalizer``, optional (default = ``None``)
        The length penalizer that should be used to rerank the candidate summaries
        after beam search has finished.
    coverage_penalizer: ``CoveragePenalizer``, optional (defautl = ``None``)
        The coverage penalizer that should be used to augment the scores of
        each prediction at each step of decoding. The sequence log-probabilities
        will be augmented by this score only for selecting the next token.

        """
        Given a starting state and a step function, apply beam search to find the
        most likely target sequences.

        Notes
        -----
        If your step function returns ``-inf`` for some log probabilities
        (like if you're using a masked log-softmax) then some of the "best"
        sequences returned may also have ``-inf`` log probability. Specifically
        this happens when the beam size is smaller than the number of actions
        with finite log probability (non-zero probability) returned by the step function.
        Therefore if you're using a mask you may want to check the results from ``search``
        and potentially discard sequences with non-finite log probability.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start_predictions : ``torch.Tensor``
            A tensor containing the initial predictions with shape ``(batch_size,)``.
            Usually the initial predictions are just the index of the "start" token
            in the target vocabulary.
        start_state : ``StateType``
            The initial state passed to the ``step`` function. Each value of the state dict
            should be a tensor of shape ``(batch_size, *)``, where ``*`` means any other
            number of dimensions.
        step : ``StepFunctionType``
            A function that is responsible for computing the next most likely tokens,
            given the current state and the predictions from the last time step.
            The function should accept two arguments. The first being a tensor
            of shape ``(group_size,)``, representing the index of the predicted
            tokens from the last time step, and the second being the current state.
            The ``group_size`` will be ``batch_size * beam_size``, except in the initial
            step, for which it will just be ``batch_size``.
            The function is expected to return a tuple, where the first element
            is a tensor of shape ``(group_size, target_vocab_size)`` containing
            the log probabilities of the tokens for the next step, and the second
            element is the updated state. The tensor in the state should have shape
            ``(group_size, *)``, where ``*`` means any other number of dimensions.

        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]
            Tuple of ``(predictions, log_probabilities)``, where ``predictions``
            has shape ``(batch_size, beam_size, max_steps)`` and ``log_probabilities``
            has shape ``(batch_size, beam_size)``. The beam position is the order
            of the "best" predictions according to the search (regardless of the
            order of the log-probabilities) because the output order takes into
            account the length penalty.
