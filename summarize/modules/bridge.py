class Bridge(torch.nn.Module, FromParams):
    """
    The ``Bridge`` module is used to pass the final encoder states of an RNN
    through a linear layer before initializing the decoder RNN. There is a separate
    linear layer for each hidden state (e.g., 2 for LSTM, 1 for GRU).

    This implementation allows for using the same parameters for both the
    forward and backward RNNs, as in the OpenNMT implementation of the bridge.
    The input to forward is expected to be tensors of size ``(batch_size, encoder_hidden_size)``.
    If the encoder is bidirectional, both directions' hidden states are expected to be
    already concatenated together. If ``share_parameters`` is set, the input
    tensors are reshaped into ``(batch_size, 2, encoder_hidden_size // 2)``-sized tensors,
    passed through the linear layers, and then reshaped back to the expected output sizes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    layers: ``List[FeedForward]``
        The linear layers, one for each hidden state of the RNN.
    share_parameters: ``bool``, optional (default = ``False``)
        Indicates whether the forward and backward directions should share the
        same linear layer parameters.
