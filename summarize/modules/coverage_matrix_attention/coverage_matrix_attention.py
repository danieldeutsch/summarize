    """
    The ``CoverageMatrixAttention`` computes a matrix of attention probabilities
    between the encoder and decoder outputs. The attention function has access
    to the cumulative probabilities that the attention has assigned to each
    input token previously. In addition to the attention probabilities, the function
    should return the coverage vectors which were used to compute the distribution
    at each time step as well as the new coverage vector which takes into account
    the function's computation.

    The module must compute the probabilities instead of the raw scores (like
    the ``MatrixAttention`` module does) because the coverage vector contains
    the accumulated probabilities.
