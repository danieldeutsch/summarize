'' Here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court .", "Most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that Judge Steven Leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' He says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . Mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to Leifman .", "So , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail .", "We toured the jail with Leifman . He is well known in Miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . Even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . Go inside the 'forgotten floor ' \u00bb .", "At first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . The prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . Imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . They 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . That 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses .", "Leifman says about one-third of all people in Miami-Dade county jails are mentally ill . So , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor .", "Of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . We see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells .", "`` I am the son of the president . You need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me .", "He is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the White House .", "Leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . It 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in Miami .", "Over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients .", "Leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . They were just considered unfit to be in society .", "Over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . But Leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down .", "Where did the patients go ? Nowhere . The streets . They became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . They never got treatment .", "Leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals .", "The judge says he 's working to change this . Starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment .", "Leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . Leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . The patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again .", "And , for Leifman , justice is served .
